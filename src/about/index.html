            The Fairfield Programming Association is from Fairfield, Connecticut
            and is an open-source, 501(c)(3) organization. We run a number of
            programs to help educate high-school and college students-
            especially those who do not have access to programs.

            <h2>Our Headquarters</h2>
            <p>
              The Fairfield Programming Association is headquartered at Greens
              Farms Academy in Westport. The campus was donated by the
              Vanderbilt family and the original mansion is still intact.
              Members of the Fairfield Programming Association will be able to
              tour the school and all of its beauty.
